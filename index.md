### About

In April 2017, I received my Ph.D. from the [School of Statistics](http://stat.umn.edu) at the University of Minnesota under the supervision of [Prof. Adam J. Rothman](http://users.stat.umn.edu/~arothman). Before that, I graduated *cum laude* from St. Olaf College in Northfield, MN with a BA in Mathematics and concentration in Statistics. In May 2017, I moved to the Biostatistics Program at the[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) in Seattle, WA. 


My research interests are in multivariate analysis, optimization, and machine learning. In particular, I'm interested in developing computationally efficient and model-based methods for classification, regression, model-based clustering, and dimension reduction. More generally, I'm interested in reproducible research, statistical applications in genomics, and computing. During the 2016-2017 academic year, my research was supported by the [Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship](https://www.grad.umn.edu/funding-tuition/ddf) from the University of Minnesota.
