I received my Ph.D. from the [School of Statistics](http://stat.umn.edu) at the University of Minnesota under the supervision of [Adam J. Rothman](http://users.stat.umn.edu/~arothman). Before that, I graduated *cum laude* from St. Olaf College in Northfield, MN with a BA in Mathematics and a concentration in Statistics. In 2017, I moved to the [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) in Seattle, WA, where I work with [Li Hsu](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/profiles/hsu-li.html) and [Wei Sun](https://research.fhcrc.org/sun/en.html). 

My research interests are in multivariate analysis and numerical optimization. In particular, I'm interested in developing  computationally efficient and model-based methods for classification, regression, clustering, and dimension reduction, with an emphasis on methods that are applicable to statistical genetics and genomics. 

Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments about any of my work.
