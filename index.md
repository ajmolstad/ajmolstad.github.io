I received my Ph.D. from the [School of Statistics](http://stat.umn.edu) at the University of Minnesota under the supervision of [Adam J. Rothman](http://users.stat.umn.edu/~arothman). Before that, I graduated *cum laude* from St. Olaf College in Northfield, MN with a BA in Mathematics and a concentration in Statistics. In 2017, I moved to the [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) in Seattle, WA. 

My research interests are in multivariate analysis and numerical optimization. In particular, I'm interested in developing  computationally efficient and model-based methods for classification, regression, clustering, and dimension reduction, with an emphasis on methods that are applicable to statistical genetics and genomics.
