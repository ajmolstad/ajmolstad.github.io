I received my Ph.D. from the [School of Statistics at the University of Minnesota](http://stat.umn.edu) in 2017. My thesis was supervised by [Adam J. Rothman](http://users.stat.umn.edu/~arothman). Before that, I graduated from [St. Olaf College](https://wp.stolaf.edu/) in Northfield, MN with a BA in Mathematics and a concentration in Statistics. In 2017, I moved to the [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) in Seattle, WA, where I worked with [Li Hsu](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/profiles/hsu-li.html) and [Wei Sun](https://research.fhcrc.org/sun/en.html). In 2019, I joined the [Department of Statistics](http://stat.ufl.edu/) at the [University of Florida](http://ufl.edu/) as Assistant Professor, and in 2020, became a member of the [University of Florida Genetics Institute](http://ufgi.ufl.edu/).

My research interests are in multivariate analysis, numerical optimization, statistical computing, tensor-valued data analysis, and more broadly, machine learning. My goal is to develop computationally efficient and model-based methods for classification, regression, clustering, and dimension reduction, with an emphasis on methods that are applicable in statistical genetics, genomics, and single-cell data analyses. 

Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments about my work.
