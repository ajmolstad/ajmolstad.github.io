My research interests are in multivariate analysis, numerical optimization, and more broadly, statistical and machine learning. My goal is to develop computationally efficient and model-based methods for classification, regression, clustering, and dimension reduction, with an emphasis on applications in modern "omics" data analyses (transcriptomics, proteomics, etc). For a brief overview of my interests (as of 2023), see <a href="https://cla.umn.edu/statistics/news-events/profile/im-interested-how-life-works" style="text-decoration": underline;>this interview</a>.
